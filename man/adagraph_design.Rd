\title{Make a new (generic) trial design}
\usage{
adagraph_design(
  correlation = matrix(),
  weights = double(),
  alpha = double(),
  test_m = matrix()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{correlation}{Correlation matrix describing the structure of the correlations
between the different hypotheses, use NA for uncorrelated}

\item{weights}{List of weights, measuring how important each hypothesis is}

\item{alpha}{Single number, measuring what total alpha should be spent on the FWER}

\item{test_m}{Transition matrix describing the graph for the closed test procedure to test the hypotheses}
}
\value{
An object of class adagraph_design
}
