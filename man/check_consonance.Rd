\title{Check if a design is consonant}
\usage{
check_consonance(
  design,
  adapted = design$adaptions,
  stage = "both",
  weights = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A cer_design object}

\item{adapted}{Boolean, use the adapted or original values}

\item{stage}{For which stage should the consonance be tested? Can be one of
"both", "interim", "final". No effect if weights = TRUE.}

\item{weights}{Boolean, if TRUE uses the weights instead of the actual
bounds. This is the same when no correlation structure is used, and else
checks consonance of the counterfactual where the graph used is the same,
but no use of correlation structure is made}
}
\value{
A boolean value, TRUE if the design (for the specified weights) is
consonant, else FALSE
}
\description{
For some CER design, see if the defined test sequence is consonant, either
from just it's graph and weights, also using the correlation structure, or
after some adaption.
}
\details{
For every combination of hypothesis of a design, a intersection hypothesis is
being built that is keeping the specified alpha level, and only when all
intersection hypothesis holding a specific hypothesis are rejected, that
hypothesis is rejected. Consonance now means that whenever a intersection
hypothesis is rejected, at least one intersection hypothesis that is a
superset of this one is rejected. If a design is not consonant, it is in some
sense not optimal
