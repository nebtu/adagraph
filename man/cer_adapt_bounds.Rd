\title{Adjust bounds after changing some design parameters}
\usage{
cer_adapt_bounds(design)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A cer_design object}
}
\value{
A cer_design object, with the new bounds calculated
}
\description{
This function calculates the new bounds for the p-values for the final test.
It should be run once after finishing all adaptions after the interim test,
if the \code{adapt_bounds} option was not true for the last adaption anyway.
}

as <- function(x,t) 2-2*pnorm(qnorm(1-x/2)/sqrt(t))
