assuming a fixed population}
\usage{
redistribute_n(
  n,
  t = NA,
  n1 = NA,
  which_drop = NA,
  simple_redistribute = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{vector of number of people for each arm of the trial}

\item{t}{time fraction at which the second stage begins}

\item{n1}{number of people used in the first stage, instead of t}

\item{which_drop}{list of arms to drop, by their index in n}

\item{simple_redistribute}{if the distribution of the dropped arms to the
rest has remainders, wether those remainders are distributed to the largest
ramainders or simply to the first in the list

Either t or n1 needs to be specified
If $t * n$ is not an integer, the number of people in the first stage is
rounded down}
}
\value{
list of number of people in the second stage for all the arms
(including dropped ones)
