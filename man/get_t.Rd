\title{Get the time fractions for given sample sizes}
\usage{
get_t(n_cont_1, n_cont_2, n_treat_1, n_treat_2)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_cont_1, n_cont_2}{vector containing sample sizes for control groups in
the first and second stage of the trial}

\item{n_treat_1, n_treat_2}{vector containing sample sizes for treatment
groups in the first and second stage of the trial}
}
\description{
Get the information time fractions for the planned interim test for
given trial arms, given the sample sizes in treatment and control groups
}
\examples{
#trivial case with equal ratios throughout
get_t(50, 50, 50, 50)

#different sample sizes in the second trial stage, but constant allocation ratio
get_t(
  n_cont_1 = c(50, 50, 50, 50),
  n_cont_2 = c(50, 75, 100, 150),
  n_treat_1 = c(50, 50, 50, 50),
  n_treat_2 = c(50, 75, 100, 150)
)

#changing allocation ratio in the second stage:
# the rate and number of control group patients stays the same, but treatment
# group allocation is different
get_t(
  n_cont_1 = c(50, 50, 50, 50),
  n_cont_2 = c(50, 50, 50, 50),
  n_treat_1 = c(50, 50, 50, 50),
  n_treat_2 = c(25, 50, 100, 150)
