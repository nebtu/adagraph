\value{
An object of class c("cer_design", "adagraph_design"), whith the following elements:
\itemize{
\item correlation: correlation matrix of the hypotheses, as given
\item weights: list of weights of the hypotheses, as given
\item alpha: overall FWER, as given
\item hyp_matrix: matrix of format #intersection-hypotheses x #hypotheses where
each row specifies which hypothosis is part of the given intersection hypotheses
\item weights_matrix: same format as hyp_matrix, but each row specifies
the weights of the hypotheses for the given intersection hypothesis
\item closed_matrix: each of the #hypothesis columns specifies which
intersection hypotheses need to be tested to reject the given hypothesis
\item test_m: transition matrix of the graph, as given
\item alpha_spending_f: alpha spending function, as given
\item seq_bonf: as given
\item prep_t: as given
\item bounds_1: matrix of same format as hyp_matrix, where each row gives the bounds for rejection of the intersection hypothesis at the first stage
\item bounds_2: same as bounds_1, but for rejection at the second stage according to the preplanned design
\item cJ1: values used for calulation of bounds_1, bounds_1 := cJ1 * weights (with rowwise multiplication)
\item cJ2: as cJ1, but for bounds_2
}
