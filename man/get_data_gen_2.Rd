\title{Get a data generating function for simulating the second stage of a trial}
\usage{
get_data_gen_2(corr_control, corr_treatment, eff)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_control}{correlation matrix for all the control endpoints}

\item{corr_treatment}{correlation matrix for all the treatment endpoints}

\item{eff}{vector of effect sizes (i.e. means) of the different treatment
endpoints (compared to the control)}
}
\value{
A function taking two arguments, see details
}
\description{
Generates a data generating function that give p-values from an unpaired
t-test of data generated by multivariate normal distribution as
specified by the arguments and the specification for the trials second stage
}
\details{
This function mostly works like \code{get_data_gen()}, see there for most details
to the data generation.
However, instead of specifing the treatment and control data size, this is
taken from the specification of the second stage of the given multiarm_cer_design.

Internally, the resulting function uses \code{get_data_gen()} to get a suitable
data generation function each time it is called and immediately uses it to
generate the data. Therefore, using \code{get_data_gen()} should be prefered from a
performance standpoint whenever possible.
