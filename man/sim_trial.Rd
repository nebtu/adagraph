sim_trial(
  design,
  runs1,
  runs2,
  adapt_rule,
  data_gen_1,
  data_gen_2,
  include_designs = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{cer_design object to be used for the simulation}

\item{runs1}{Number of trials to run in the first stage}

\item{runs2}{Number of second stage to run for every first stage trial}

\item{adapt_rule}{function that takes a cer_design object after the first interim test and
returns the same object with appropiate adaptions}

\item{data_gen_1}{function for generating first stage data, see details}

\item{data_gen_2}{function for generating second stage data, see details}

\item{include_designs}{boolean indicating whether to include the designs objects in the output}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the various results
}
\description{
Run a series of simulated trials according to a specified design, with
}
\details{
data_gen_1 should take a single argument, the number of trials to simulate
The function is only called a single time and
should return a matrix or dataframe with each row being the p-values for a single trial.

data_gen_2 should take two arguments, the number of trials to simulate and the adapted design object,
and return in the same format as data_gen_1.
