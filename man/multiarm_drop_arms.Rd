\title{Drop arm from a multiarm design}
\usage{
multiarm_drop_arms(
  design,
  arms,
  n_cont_2 = NA,
  n_treat_2 = NA,
  alt_adj = FALSE,
  adapt_bounds = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{multiarm_design object}

\item{arms}{list of with integers specifing which arms should be dropped}

\item{n_cont_2, n_treat_2}{list of number of datapoints for the control and
treatment groups
Can be different for different groups. The lenght should be equal to the
number of control/treatment groups, including dropped treatments, which
will always be set to 0}

\item{alt_adj}{uses \code{cer_alt_drop_hypotheses()} for dropping the hypotheses
instead of \code{cer_drop_hypotheses()}}

\item{adapt_bounds}{Adapt the bounds for rejecting a hypotheses to keep the
FWER with the new adaptions, see \code{cer_adapt()}}
}
\description{
This adapts a multiarm design by dropping a treatment arm and adjusting the
number of datapoints
}
\details{
The weights of the dropped hypotheses are set to 0 and distributed according
to the prespecified graph, similarly to \code{cer_drop_hypotheses()}
If specified, the time fraction of the interim test will also be
adapted according to the number of data points in the second stage, assuming
the first stage n was as planned accoring to t.
