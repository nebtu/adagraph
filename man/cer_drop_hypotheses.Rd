\title{Adapt a cer design by dropping hypotheses}
\usage{
cer_drop_hypotheses(design, hypotheses)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{cer_design object}

\item{hypotheses}{vector of booleans indicating for each hypotheses if it should be dropped}
}
\value{
design with specified hypotheses dropped (so TRUE means the hypothesis is dropped)
}
\description{
The weights of the dropped hypotheses are set to 0 and distributed according to the prespecified graph.
}
\examples{
as <- function(x,t) 2-2*pnorm(qnorm(1-x/2)/sqrt(t))
design <- cer_design(
 correlation=rbind(H1=c(1, NA),
                   H2=c(NA, 1)),
 weights=c(2/3, 1/3),
 alpha=0.05,

              c(1, 0)),

design <- cer_interim_test(design, c(0.1, 0.02))
