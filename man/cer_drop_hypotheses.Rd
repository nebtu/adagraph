\title{Adapt a cer design by dropping hypotheses}
\usage{
cer_drop_hypotheses(design, hypotheses, adapt_bounds = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{cer_design object}

\item{hypotheses}{vector of booleans indicating for each hypotheses if it should be dropped}

\item{adapt_bounds}{Adapt the bounds for rejecting a hypotheses to keep the
FWER with the new adaptions. If doing multiple adaptions, it is enough to
adapt bounds only for the last one, or call \code{adapt_bounds()} manually
after.}
}
\value{
design with specified hypotheses dropped (so TRUE means the hypothesis is dropped)
}
\description{
The weights of the dropped hypotheses are set to 0 and distributed according to the prespecified graph.
However, the time fraction is not adapted, this needs to be done manually if desired.
}
