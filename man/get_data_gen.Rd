\title{Get a data generating function for simulating a trial}
\usage{
get_data_gen(corr_control, corr_treatment, eff, n_cont, n_treat)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_control}{correlation matrix for all the control endpoints}

\item{corr_treatment}{correlation matrix for all the treatment endpoints}

\item{eff}{vector of effect sizes (i.e. means) of the different treatment
endpoints (compared to the control)}

\item{n_cont}{number of data points in the control endpoints}

\item{n_treat}{number of data points in the treatment endpoints}
}
\value{
A function taking two arguments, see details
}
\description{
Generates a data generating function that give p-values from an unpaired
t-test of data generated by multivariate normal distribution as
specified
}
\details{
This gives back a function, which takes as its arguments a number n and a
multiarm_cer_design object and returns a matrix of n * number of treatments
p-values. Each of those p-values is generated by drawing as many data points
as specified in the design object with the given correlation and mean, and
comparing it with a t-test to the data points generated for the controls
specified by treatment_assoc of the design object.
