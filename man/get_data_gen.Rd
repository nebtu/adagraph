\title{Get a data generating function for simulating a trial}
\usage{
get_data_gen(
  corr_control,
  corr_treatment,
  eff,
  n_cont,
  n_treat,
  binary = integer(0),
  bin_con_resp = NULL,
  bin_treat_resp = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_control}{correlation matrix for all the control endpoints}

\item{corr_treatment}{correlation matrix for all the treatment endpoints}

\item{eff}{vector of effect sizes (i.e. means) of the different treatment
endpoints (compared to the control)}

\item{n_cont}{number of data points in the control endpoints}

\item{n_treat}{number of data points in the treatment endpoints}

\item{binary}{which treatment endpoints are binary endpoints (all control
endpoints referenced by those are also automatically treated as binary)}

\item{bin_con_resp}{response rate of the binary control groups}

\item{bin_treat_resp}{response rate of the binary treatment groups}
}
\value{
A function taking two arguments, see details
}
\description{
Generates a data generating function that give p-values from an unpaired
t-test of data generated by multivariate normal distribution as
specified
}
\details{
This gives back a function, which takes as its arguments a number n and a
multiarm_cer_design object and returns a matrix of n * number of treatments
p-values. Each of those p-values is generated by drawing as many data points
as specified in the design object with the given correlation and mean, and
comparing it with a t-test to the data points generated for the controls
specified by treatment_assoc of the design object.
}
\section{Binary endpoints}{
Binary endpoints have to be specified separately. Using means that eff does
not get used anymore for those endpoints, but correlation between the
endpoints is still given, since the binary endpoint is calculated from the
normal data. Additionally, this currently assumes that the covariance of all
binary endpoints (so the diagonal value of the correlations) is 1

The test used for the enpoints is a one-sided two-proportion z-test, where
the tested outcome is a higher response rate for the treatment group.
