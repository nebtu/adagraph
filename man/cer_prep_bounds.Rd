\title{Calculate bounds for preplanned test}
\usage{
cer_prep_bounds(correlation, weights, alpha, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{correlation}{matrix describing the correlation structure of the hypotheses}

\item{weights}{list of weights of the given hypotheses, same length as hypotheses}

\item{alpha}{list of length 2 describing the amount of alpha spent that the test of the hypotheses
should adhere to in the first and second stage respectively}

\item{t}{information fraction at which the first stage test is planned}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item bounds_1: vector of same length as weights with bounds for the first interim test
\item cJ1: number that gets multiplied by the weights to get bounds_1
\item bounds_1: vector of same lenght as weights with bounds for the planned final test
\item cJ2: number that gets multiplied by the weights to get bounds_2
}
}
\description{
Calculates the bounds and cJ values for the p-values for the interim test and the planned final test
}

 #simple non-parametric bonferroni
