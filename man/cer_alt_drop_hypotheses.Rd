\title{Adapt a cer design by dropping hypotheses, with a simplified strategy for redistributing weights}
\usage{
cer_alt_drop_hypotheses(design, hypotheses, adapt_bounds = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{cer_design object}

\item{hypotheses}{vector of booleans indicating for each hypotheses if it should be dropped}

\item{adapt_bounds}{Adapt the bounds for rejecting a hypotheses to keep the
FWER with the new adaptions. If doing multiple adaptions, it is enough to
adapt bounds only for the last one, or call \code{adapt_bounds()} manually
after.}
}
\value{
design with specified hypotheses dropped (so TRUE means the hypothesis is dropped)
}
\description{
The weights of the dropped hypotheses are set to 0 and distributed proportionally to the previous weight to the other hypotheses.
This means the weights "stay the same", they are only adapted to still sum up to 1.
Note that this method does not lead to an adapted graph that is coherent with the actual weight distribution, this may lead to problems down the line

as <- function(x,t) 2-2*pnorm(qnorm(1-x/2)/sqrt(t))
