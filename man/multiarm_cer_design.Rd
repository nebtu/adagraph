\title{Make a new multiarm CER trial design}
\usage{
multiarm_cer_design(
  controls = integer(),
  treatment_assoc = integer(),
  n_controls = integer(),
  n_treatments = integer(),
  weights = double(),
  t = double(),
  alpha = double(),
  test_m = matrix(),
  alpha_spending_f = function() {
 },
  seq_bonf = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{controls}{Number of control groups}

\item{treatment_assoc}{Vector of integer, corresponding to the number of the
control group for each treatment group. The length determines the number of
treatment groups}

\item{n_controls}{Integer (or vector of integers) determining the number of
patients in each control group}

\item{n_treatments}{Integer (or vector of integers) determining the number of
patients in each treatment group}

\item{weights}{List of weights, measuring how important each hypothesis is}

\item{t}{information fraction, at which fraction of assigned people will the
interim analysis happen}

\item{alpha}{Single number, measuring what total alpha should be spent on the FWER}

\item{test_m}{Transition matrix describing the graph for
the closed test procedure to test the hypotheses}

\item{alpha_spending_f}{alpha spending function, taking parameters
alpha (for overall spent alpha) and t (information fraction at interim test)}

\item{seq_bonf}{automatically reject hypotheses at the second stage
if the sum of their PCER is greater 1}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{multiarm_cer_design}
}
\description{
Returns an object of class \code{multiarm_cer_design}.
This can be used for clinical trials with multiple arms and control groups
that might have adaptations controlled for using the conditional error method.
