\title{Get the Conditional Error Rate for a intersection of hypotheses}
\usage{
get_cer(p_values, weights, cJ2, correlation, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_values}{vector of stage 1 p-values for the hypothesis}

\item{weights}{weight to give to each hypothesis, ignoring all with weight 0}

\item{cJ2}{factor used for deciding if the hypothesis should be rejected}

\item{correlation}{matrix describing a potential known correlation structure
between some hypotheses. Use NA for unkown correlations}

\item{t}{information time fraction at which the interim test is performed}
}
\value{
a single number greater than 0, the CER
}
\description{
Gives the CER (condtional error rate) for a given set of hypotheses, with arbitrary
weights and correlation between the hypotheses.
This is an upper bound on the probabilty of rejecting all the hypotheses
with weight greater 0 under the null hypothesis conditional on the stage one
data, assuming we reject whenever a final p-value is smaller than cJ2 * weight
}
\details{
Note that if the correlation between some values is unkown, the result may be
greater than 1, see also the examples
}
\examples{
#the CER is high (even >1) if the p_values of the first stage are already low
get_cer(
 c(0.01, 0.01, 0.9, 0.9),
 c(1, 1, 0, 0),
 0.05,
 matrix(rep(NA, 16), nrow = 4),
 0.5
)

#and lower otherwise
get_cer(
 c(0.01, 0.01, 0.9, 0.9),
 c(0, 0, 1, 1),
 0.05,
 matrix(rep(NA, 16), nrow = 4),
 0.5
)
