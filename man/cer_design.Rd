\title{Make a new CER trial design}
\usage{
cer_design(
  correlation = matrix(),
  weights = double(),
  alpha = double(),
  test_m = matrix(),
  alpha_spending_f = function() {
 },
  prep_t = double(),
  seq_bonf = TRUE,
  parallelize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{correlation}{Correlation matrix describing the structure of the correlations
between the different hypotheses, use NA for uncorrelated}

\item{weights}{List of weights, measuring how important each hypothesis is}

\item{alpha}{Single number, measuring what total alpha should be spent on the FWER}

\item{test_m}{Transition matrix describing the graph for the closed test procedure to test the hypotheses}

\item{alpha_spending_f}{alpha spending function, taking parameters alpha (for overall spent alpha) and t (information fraction at interim test)}

\item{prep_t}{numeric between 0 and 1 specifing the planned time fraction for the interim test}

\item{seq_bonf}{to automatically reject hypotheses at the second stage if the sum of their PCER is greater 1}

\item{parallelize}{set TRUE to use parrallization, for now only available on unix systems}
}
\value{
An object of class cer_design
}
\description{
Returns an object of class cer_design.
This can be used for clinical trials with potential adaptions that are controlled
for using the conditional error method.
